This repository contains the standard datasets used by 
[Ferret](http://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/Ferret) 
and 
[PyFerret](http://github.com/NOAA-PMEL/PyFerret)

The value of the `Ferret`/`PyFerret` environment variable `$FER_DSETS` 
should be a directory with the contents of this repository. 
(So the `$FER_DSETS` directory contains the `data`, `descr`, and 
`grids` subdirectories.)

Lastest update (despite add the removed and re-added files) was just 
updates to Eritria and river outlets in `geo_borders.cdf` and 
`geo_borders_intermed.nc`, and adding `geo-hawaii_fine.nc` and 
`noaa_logo.cdf`.
